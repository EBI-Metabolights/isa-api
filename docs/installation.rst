**Requires: Python 3.4 or 3.5; additionally Java 1.6+ for validator and SRA conversion**

We recommend using a virtual environment for your Python projects. `virtualenv` is a tool for creating isolated Python runtime environments. It does not install separate copies of Python, but rather it does provide a clever way to keep different configurations of environment cleanly separated.

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, one of the following two commands will work for you:

``$ sudo easy_install virtualenv``

or even better:

``$ sudo pip install virtualenv``

For full instructions on installing and using ``virtualenv`` see `their documentation <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org>`_.

The ISA API is published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) as the `isatools` package, and you can use `pip` to install it.

``pip install isatools``

Now you're ready to get started!
