ISA tools API
#############

The ISA tools API is published on PyPI as the ``isatools`` Python package. The package aims to provide you, the developer, with a set of tools to help you easily and quickly build your own ISA objects, validate, and convert between serializations of ISA-formatted datasets and other formats/schemas (e.g. `SRA schemas <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/read-xml-format-1-5>`_). The goal of this package is to provide a flexible way to build and use ISA content, as well as provide utility functions for file conversions and validation.
