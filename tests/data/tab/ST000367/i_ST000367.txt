STUDY
Study Identifier	ST000102
Study Title	Cold adaptation shapes the robustness of metabolic networks in Drosophilamelanogaster
Study Description	 Metabolites of cold hardy versus cold susceptible flies were compared using N less than R-based metabolomics. We used 8 replicates per line (2 hardy lines, two susceptible lines), and sampled each line at three time points (before, during and after cold), giving rise to 96 samples total.
