Filtrate was then collected on a 0.2 um Sterivex (millipore) filter which was frozen in liquid nitrogen until nucelic acid extraction. CO2 bubbled through 11000 L mesocosm to simulate ocean acidification predicted conditions. Then phosphate and nitrate were added to induce a phytoplankton bloom.	"Total nucleic acid extraction was done as quickly as possible using the method of Neufeld et al, 2007."	"RNA MinElute + substrative Hybridization + MEGAclear For transcriptomics, total RNA was separated from the columns using the RNA MinElute clean-up kit (Qiagen) and checked for integrity of rRNA using an Agilent bioanalyser (RNA nano6000 chip). High integrity rRNA is essential for subtractive hybridization. Samples were treated with Turbo DNA-free enzyme (Ambion) to remove contaminating DNA. The rRNA was removed from mRNA by subtractive hybridization (Microbe Express Kit, Ambion), and absence of rRNA and DNA contamination was confirmed using the Agilent bioanalyser. The mRNA was further purified with the MEGAclearTM kit (Ambion). Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed using the SuperScript III enzyme (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers (Promega). The cDNA was treated with RiboShredderTM RNase Blend (Epicentre) to remove trace RNA contaminants. To improve the yield of cDNA, samples were subjected to random amplification using the GenomiPhi V2 method (GE Healthcare). GenomiPhi technology produces branched DNA molecules that are recalcitrant to the pyrosequencing methodology. Therefore amplified samples were treated with S1 nuclease using the method of Zhang et al.2006."		superscript+random hexamer primer		"1. Sample Input and Fragmentation: The Genome Sequencer FLX System supports the sequencing of samples from a wide variety of starting materials including genomic DNA, PCR products, BACs, and cDNA. Samples such as genomic DNA and BACs are fractionated into small, 300- to 800-base pair fragments. For smaller samples, such as small non-coding RNA or PCR amplicons, fragmentation is not required. Instead, short PCR products amplified using Genome Sequencer fusion primers can be used for immobilization onto DNA capture beads as shown below."	Study Protocol URI								Study Protocol Version								Study Protocol Parameters Name	filter pore size					library strategy;library layout;library selection;library source	sequencing instrument	Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Accession Number						;;		Study Protocol Parameters Name Term Source REF						;;		Study Protocol Components Name								Study Protocol Components Type								Study Protocol Components Type Term Accession Number								Study Protocol Components Type Term Source REF								STUDY CONTACTS								Study Person Last Name	Smith							Study Person First Name	Henry							Study Person Mid Initials	A							Study Person Email	henry.smith@bbsrc.co.uk							Study Person Phone								Study Person Fax								Study Person Address	some address							Study Person Affiliation	some institution							Study Person Roles	principal investigator role;SRA Inform On Status;SRA Inform On Error							Study Person Roles Term Accession Number	;;							Study Person Roles Term Source REF	;;							Comment[Study Person REF]
