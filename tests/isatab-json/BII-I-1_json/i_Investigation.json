        "investigationDescription": "Background\nCell growth underlies many key cellular and developmental processes, yet a limited number of studies have been carried out on cell-growth regulation. Comprehensive studies at the transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic levels under defined controlled conditions are currently lacking.\nResults\nMetabolic control analysis is being exploited in a systems biology study of the eukaryotic cell. Using chemostat culture, we have measured the impact of changes in flux (growth rate) on the transcriptome, proteome, endometabolome and exometabolome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each functional genomic level shows clear growth-rate-associated trends and discriminates between carbon-sufficient and carbon-limited conditions. Genes consistently and significantly upregulated with increasing growth rate are frequently essential and encode evolutionarily conserved proteins of known function that participate in many protein-protein interactions. In contrast, more unknown, and fewer essential, genes are downregulated with increasing growth rate; their protein products rarely interact with one another. A large proportion of yeast genes under positive growth-rate control share orthologs with other eukaryotes, including humans. Significantly, transcription of genes encoding components of the TOR complex (a major controller of eukaryotic cell growth) is not subject to growth-rate regulation. Moreover, integrative studies reveal the extent and importance of post-transcriptional control, patterns of control of metabolic fluxes at the level of enzyme synthesis, and the relevance of specific enzymatic reactions in the control of metabolic fluxes during cell growth.\nConclusion\nThis work constitutes a first comprehensive systems biology study on growth-rate control in the eukaryotic cell. The results have direct implications for advanced studies on cell growth, in vivo regulation of metabolic fluxes for comprehensive metabolic engineering, and for the design of genome-scale systems biology models of the eukaryotic cell.",

Although such comprehensive data sets are lacking, many studies have pointed to a central role for the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction pathway in growth control. TOR is a serine/threonine kinase that has been conserved from yeasts to mammals; it integrates signals from nutrients or growth factors to regulate cell growth and cell-cycle progression coordinately. Although such comprehensive data sets are lacking, many studies have pointed to a central role for the target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction pathway in growth control. TOR is a serine/threonine kinase that has been conserved from yeasts to mammals; it integrates signals from nutrients or growth factors to regulate cell growth and cell-cycle progression coordinately. The effect of rapamycin were studied as follows: a culture growing at mid-exponential phase was divided into two. Rapamycin (200 ng/ml) was added to one half, and the drug's solvent to the other, as the control. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h after treatment. Gene expression at the mRNA level was investigated by transcriptome analysis using Affymetrix hybridization arrays.",

The supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet resuspended in the residual medium to form a slurry. This was added in a dropwise manner directly into a 5ml Teflon flask (B. Braun Biotech, Germany) containing liquid nitrogen and a 7 mm-diameter tungsten carbide ball. After allowing evaporation of the liquid nitrogen the flask was reassembled and the cells disrupted by agitation at 1500 rpm for 2 min in a Microdismembranator U (B. Braun Biotech, Germany) \n\n2. The frozen powder was then dissolved in 1 ml of TriZol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), vortexed for 1 min, and then kept at room temperature for a further 5 min. \n\n3. Chloroform extraction was performed by addition of 0.2 ml chloroform, shaking vigorouslyor 15 s, then 5 min incubation at room temperature. \n\n4. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, the RNA (contained in the aqueous phase) was precipitated with 0.5 vol of 2-propanol at room temperature for 15 min. \n5. After further centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C) the RNA pellet was washed twice with 70 % (v/v) ethanol, briefly air-dried, and redissolved in 0.5 ml diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. \n\n6. The single-stranded RNA was precipitated once more by addition of 0.5 ml of LiCl bffer (4 M LiCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA), thus removing tRNA and DNA from the sample. \n\n7. After precipitation (20 C for 1h) and centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 C), the RNA was washed twice in 70 % (v/v) ethanol prior to being dissolved in a minimal volume of DEPC-treated water.\n\n 8. Total RNA quality was checked using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay, and analysed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). RNA was quantified using the Nanodrop ultra low volume spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies).",
