<h1>ISATAB submissions into the BII</h1>


<strong>TODO</strong>: this document is outdated and to be reviewed.

<p>This file explains the specific setting and procedures in use at the EBI, for managing ISATAB submissions into the
    BII
    repository. Please refer to the <a href="../../../../readme.html">general readme file</a> for general instructions
    on
    how to use import layer commands. (TODO: URLs for the binary distro)</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>
    The BII software packages are installed under <code>/nfs/ma/home/NETproject/svn</code>.
    The import layer package is there, under <code>import_layer</code>. So, the commands referred in the readme, are
    under
    <code>/nfs/ma/home/NETproject/svn/import_layer/mvn_bin</code>. <b>Please note</b>: it seems that Lucene doesn't like
    relative paths, so use the absolute ones hereby reported.
</p>

<p>
    Although the files are accessible to all users under UNIX neteam group, the preferred user for accessing them is
    netuser.
    This is indeed a virtual user, and can be accessed in two ways. Either you first login to an EBI host with your
    usual
    user and then issue "become netuser". Or you add your public SSH key to
    <code>&lt;netuser-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Since netuser is not a regular UNIX user, we cannot setup a
    password for it and use it straight via SSH.
</p>

<p>
    Configuration parameters can be set in <code>mvn_bin/config.properties</code>. These include the connection to the
    relational BII database and the data file repositories where the data files are stored during the persistence step.
    The latter usually point to <code>/ebi/ftp/pub/databases/bii</code>, which is the space allocated for BII under the
    EBI's anonymous FTP.
</p>

<h3>Multiple configurations</h3>

<p>
    You'll typically need to work with different configurations (e.g.: test/production database or file repositories).
    We suggest that you keep different <code>.properties</code> files. and copy into
    <code>configuration.properties</code>
    the one you need.
</p>

<p>
    <code>config.properties</code> has also a parameter for setting the location of Lucene index. But if it doesn't
    work,
    use one of ebi_nfs_* profiles.
</p>


<h2>Rebuilding the import layer package</h2>

<p>
    <i>(NOTE: this note is mainly for developers)</i>. All the packages are an SVN working copy, so that they can be
    updated
    via SVN. To rebuild the import layer you need to run <code>"maven install"</code> with the profiles: oracle
    (or oracle_submission, depending on the database you want), nodrop, ebi_nfs. Unfortunately it's not possible to
    switch
    database type by only changing parameters in <code>configuration.properties</code>. To be fixed in future.
</p>


<h2>The Submission workflow @BII system - EBI</h2>

<p>
    Our typical submission workflow has the following steps (see also: TODO: Susanna's slides).
</p>

<p>
<dl>

    <dt>
        <script>step('init');</script>
        User sends us the ISATAB archive
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                The preferred way to do that is via FTP. We have a single FTP account for FTP uploads, where we simulate
                multiple private user accounts, by 1) making the root level of the FTP account file system non
                browseable and
                2) by assigning to each user a directory with an obfuscated, non guessable name, such as <code>"user1_ug675gh6r"</code>.
                At the time of writing these personal directories must be created for each new user.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                From now on, we will refer to the directory <code>user1/</code>, meaning a user's personal directory.
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    User1 can upload two things in its directory, either an ISATAB archive file, i.e.: a file named like
                    <code>submission1.zip</code>
                    or <code>submission1.tar.bz2</code>, or a directory that contains the single ISATAB submission
                    (<code>submission1/</code>,
                    and that is the exploded version of an archive. In both cases
                    create a working copy, under <code>user1</code>, We suggest that you do that by exploding the
                    archive into
                    <code>submission1</code>, under the user's FTP directory (<code>user1/</code>), or by copying <code>submission1/</code>
                    to <code>submission1_original/</code> and making <code>submission1/</code> the working copy. This is
                    either the name
                    we will use in the follow as an example of working copy.
                </p>

                <p><i>
                    We strongly suggest to keep an untouched copy of the original submission, both for reference and
                    because the
                    submission process requires several changes to what the end user provides us.
                </i></p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Details:</p>

        <p>
            Let's see some details with an example. Let's suppose the <code>user1</code> wants to send <code>submission1.zip</code>.
            First, he/she will have its user1_&lt;code&gt; directory under the FTP account named: 'biiup', so, do
            something like:

        <p><textarea cols="80" readonly="true">
            $ cd /ebi/ftp/private/biiup # This is the NFS path for the biiup FTP account
            $ mkdir user1_e1031623
            $ cd ugo=rwX user1_e1031623 # Needed for FTP-accessibility
        </textarea></p>

</p>

<p>Note: a nice way to generate an 8-digits random code is:

<p><textarea cols="80" readonly="true">
    $ dd bs=1 count=4 if=/dev/random 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '"%x"'; echo ' '
    224eae8a # A tyical output of the command above
</textarea></p>

</p>

<p>Next, The user must have the parameters to upload via FTP:
<ul>
    <li>Server: ftp.ebi.ac.uk</li>
    <li>Username: biiup</li>
    <li>Password: W8DEdyMZ (i.e.: all users have the same FTP account)</li>
    <li>Initial path: /user1_e1031623 (the user must be told that this is reserved) TODO: check</li>
</ul>

<p>The user will upload <code>submission1.zip</code> into the directory above.
    Now, keep this file and create the working copy:</p>

<p><textarea cols="120" readonly="true" rows="8">
    $ cd /ebi/ftp/private/biiup

    # Ask the user to put all the files into the directory 'submission1' and then zip this. Check that the .zip is
    # like that with listing command (i.e.: "unzip -l file.zip" or "tar --list --bzip2 -f file.tar.bz2")
    $ unzip submission1.zip

    # Now you should have the submission directory under /ebi/ftp/private/biiup/submission1/
</textarea></p>

</dd>

<dt>
    <script>step('validation');</script>
    Validation
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        Run the validation, as explained in the <a href="../../../../readme.html#validation">readme file</a>,
        passing the working directory <code>submission1</code>. So in the example case above, this will be
        <code>/ebi/ftp/private/biiup/submission1</code> (plus, possibly, "<code>/&lt;investigation-file-name&gt;"</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        If the submission looks fine, go to the next step. You will need to issue ArrayExpess dispatching or PRIDE
        dispatching, or
        skip straight to the persistence step, depending on what you have in your submission. You can run the
        dispatching steps in
        any case: if the current submission doesn't contain AE or PRIDE assay files, the corresponding step won't
        generate any
        dispatching file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Change the current submission, possibly working with the user, if there are errors/problems.
    </p>
</dd>

<dt>
    <script>step('ae');</script>
    ArrayExpress Dispatching
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        Run the AE dispatching command, as explained in the <a href="../../../../readme.html#ae">readme file</a>.
        Again, in the example case above, the input directory will be <code>/ebi/ftp/private/biiup/submission1</code>
        (plus investigation
        file name, as above). We suggest to use the default as destination. By doing so, in the mentioned example,
        <code>export/ae</code> will be created under <code>/ebi/ftp/private/biiup/submission1</code>, at this level
        you'll find the
        log file of the dispatching execution, plus one directory per each ISATAB assay file that has AE as target for
        the
        dispatching. Each of these directories is a MAGETAB submission and contains the corresponding meta-data and data
        files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next step is sending the MAGETAB submissions to AE curators and wait for their feedback. In order to do that,
        copy the MAGETAB
        submissions to TODO and notify AE curators. If it is all right, you should
        get: 1) an accession for each MAGETAB submission, 2) a list of new names for the data files.
    </p>

    <p>
        Put the accession in the Investigation file, in ASSAYS section, using the field "Comment[ArrayExpress
        Accession]".
    </p>

    <p>
        Edit the assay files, change the file name columns into comment columns and replace the old names with the new
        ones.
        Also rename the data files in the submission directory. <i>NOTE: we will write a script for doing this</i>.</p>
</dd>


<dt>
    <script>step('pride');</script>
    PRIDE Dispatching
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        Similarly to the AE case, run the PRIDE dispatch command to generate PRIDE-ML files from the ISATAB submission.
        If you use
        the default destination, the <code>pride/</code> directory will be created under a directory like
        <code>/ebi/ftp/private/biiup/submission1/export/pride</code>. Here, a PRIDE-ML files is created for each MS
        assay
    </p>

    <p>
        To submit the files to PRIDE, copy it to TODO and notify the PRIDE team. You'll get one PRIDE accession per each
        MS Assay. You'll need to edit the ISATAB assay files and put the accessions in a column named "Comment[PRIDE
        Accession]".
    </p>
</dd>


<dt>
    <script>step('persist');</script>
    Persistence into the BII database
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        Once the previous steps are completed (in particular, when AE/PRIDE feedback is embedded in the working copy),
        the submission working copy can be sent to the BII database, so that it will be accessible by the web
        application.
        Run the persistence command, explained in the <a href="../../../../readme.html#persist">readme file</a>, to do
        that.
    </p>
</dd>


<dt>Unloading a submission</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        This is not much different than what explained in the <a href="../../../../readme.html#unload">readme file</a>.
        <i>Note: unfortunately the unloading of submissions from Oracle is still problematic. Please report to
            developers
            possible failings of this operation.</i>
    </p>
</dd>
