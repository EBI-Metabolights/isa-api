# isa-api

This repository is a python-based ISA-API library, which supports the programmatic creation of ISA objects, multiple ISA serializations (e.g. tabular and JSON representations) and conversions between ISA and other formats.

It relies on Python 3.4. We follow the [GitFlow development workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
